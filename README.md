## Overview
Covid Helper solves the problem of people in lockdown, who are not able to get needed medication in time. The application allows users to complete online Covid-19 test and get the probability of being infected using Machine Learning. We provide a wide network of volunteers, who are able to check the patient's locations, see the fastest route and deliver requested medication in just one day. Everyone can register as a volunteer and access Volunteer hub using their own access code.
